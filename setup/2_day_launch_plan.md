## If Blocked on Day 1

| Blocker | Quick Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Can't agree on pricing | Use competitor pricing from research, adjust after 5 services |
| No backup technician | Launch with one tech, limit to 2 services/week initially |
| Zone unclear | Pick the smallest reasonable area, expand later |
| Payment setup issues | Start with cash only, add transfer after first payment |
| Tech not available | Push launch by 3 days, don't compromise on this |

---

## If Blocked on Day 2

| Blocker | Quick Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Dry run reveals process gaps | Note them, don't fix everything - fix after real service |
| Technician doesn't understand | Meet in person, walk through with real AC unit |
| Scripts feel awkward | Adjust tone, mark for review after first 3 real uses |
| Sheet formulas broken | Manually calculate for first week, fix later |

---

## What You're NOT Doing in These 2 Days

- Building a dashboard (use raw sheets)
- Creating perfect processes (iterate after real data)
- Training backup technician fully (just identify them)
- Setting up automations (stay manual)
- Writing legal contracts (verbal + simple terms for now)
- Marketing or lead generation (that's Day 3+)

---

## Day 3+: First Real Lead

Once you complete this checklist:

1. **Announce to your warm network** (friends, family, neighbors)
2. **First lead comes in via WhatsApp**
3. **Follow the intake checklist exactly**
4. **Schedule first real service**
5. **Execute, learn, iterate**

---

## Success = Completing One Real Service

Your pilot is "launched" when:
- A real customer has paid you
- You have before/after photos
- Data is in all relevant sheets
- You learned at least one thing to improve

Everything else is iteration.
